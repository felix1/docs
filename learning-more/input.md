**Please note that both Input and Request do NOT sanitise your data, it is up to you to do that.**

## Basic Input

You may access all user input with a few simple methods. You do not need to worry about the HTTP verb used for the request, as input is accessed in the same way for all verbs.

#### Retrieving An Input Value
```php
$name = Input::get('name');
```

#### Retrieving A Default Value If The Input Value Is Absent
```php
$name = Input::get('name', 'Sally');
```

#### Determining If An Input Value Is Present
```php
if (Input::has('name'))
{
    //
}
```

#### Getting All Input For The Request
```php
$input = Input::all();
```

#### Getting Only Some Of The Request Input
```php
$input = Input::only('username', 'password');

$input = Input::except('credit_card');
```

When working on forms with "array" inputs, you may use dot notation to access the arrays:
```php
$input = Input::get('products.0.name');
```

> Note: Some JavaScript libraries such as Backbone may send input to the application as JSON. You may access this data via Input::get like normal.

## Old Input

You may need to keep input from one request until the next request. For example, you may need to re-populate a form after checking it for validation errors.

#### Flashing Input To The Session
```php
Input::flash();
```

#### Flashing Only Some Input To The Session
```php
Input::flashOnly('username', 'email');

Input::flashExcept('password');
```

Since you often will want to flash input in association with a redirect to the previous page, you may easily chain input flashing onto a redirect.

```php
return Redirect::to('form')->withInput();

return Redirect::to('form')->withInput(Input::except('password'));
```

> Note: You may flash other data across requests using the Session class.

#### Retrieving Old Data
```php
Input::old('username');
```

### Retrieving Old Data from array using dot notation

```php
Input::old('items.1');
```

## Files

#### Retrieving An Uploaded File
```php
$file = Input::file('photo');
```

#### Get uploaded file from an array by calling it's index dot notation:
````php
$file = Input::file('photo.0');
````
OR
````php
$file = Input::file('photo.1');
````

#### Determining If A File Was Uploaded
```php
if (Input::hasFile('photo'))
{
    //
}
```

The object returned by the file method is an instance of the `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\File\UploadedFile` class, which extends the PHP `SplFileInfo` class and provides a variety of methods for interacting with the file.

#### Determining If An Uploaded File Is Valid
```php
if (Input::file('photo')->isValid())
{
    //
}
```

#### Moving An Uploaded File
```php
Input::file('photo')->move($destinationPath);

Input::file('photo')->move($destinationPath, $fileName);
```

#### Retrieving The Path To An Uploaded File
```php
$path = Input::file('photo')->getRealPath();
```

#### Retrieving The Original Name Of An Uploaded File
```php
$name = Input::file('photo')->getClientOriginalName();
```

#### Retrieving The Extension Of An Uploaded File
```php
$extension = Input::file('photo')->getClientOriginalExtension();
```

#### Retrieving The Size Of An Uploaded File
```php
$size = Input::file('photo')->getSize();
```

#### Retrieving The MIME Type Of An Uploaded File
```php
$mime = Input::file('photo')->getMimeType();
```
